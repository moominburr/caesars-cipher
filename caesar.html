          Welcome to Caesar's cipher. In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's
          cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most
          widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each
          letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the
          alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B,
          and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private
          correspondence.

        <br>
        <p>You can also use the cipher to decode messages - by inputting the scrambled text and trying different cipher indexes.</p>

          Type your message into the box below and select your cipher index. Your coded message will
          be at the bottom of your screen.
